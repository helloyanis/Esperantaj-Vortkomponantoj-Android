## Build the project

To build the project, clone this repo, and open it with Android Studio to build it like any other project.

Please note that if you use the official site https://vortkom.ðŸ¦ŠðŸ’».ws your build will have an extra URL bar to show it still goes to my site. This is a feature of AndroidBrowserHelper which require [digital asset links](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) on the website which mach the app's signature, to make sure the app doesn't connect to a malicious website.

To fix this, you can also [clone the website](https://github.com/helloyanis/Esperantaj-Vortkomponantoj), and edit the [assetlinks.json](https://github.com/helloyanis/Esperantaj-Vortkomponantoj/blob/main/.well-known/assetlinks.json) file to [include your build's signature](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/android-for-web-devs#digital-asset-links).

> *Note to F-Droid team* : Please do **not** follow the fix! Once the app is built on F-Droid, I will update the digital asset links to match the app's signature!
